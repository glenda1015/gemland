Developed a 3D game using Unity

Gameplay:
The Unity PC game is set in a forest with Japanese elements. The player has to collect ten gems, while
simultaneously dealing with spawning enemies that will attack the user from different directions. The
player is equipped with a gun, which can be used to shoot and kill enemies or collect gems. The game
features a gem detection system and a health bar to keep track of the player's health throughout the
game.
The player can move around the forest and jump to avoid obstacles and enemy attacks. The gun is
always available to the player and can be used to shoot at enemies or collect gems. The gems are
scattered throughout the map and emit a sound that increases as the player gets closer to them, making
it easier to locate them. The gem count is displayed on the game's UI, so the player can keep track of
how many gems they have collected so far.
The game features a health bar that decreases every time the player is hit by an enemy attack. If the
health bar reaches zero before the player has collected all ten gems, the player loses the game. If the
player collects all ten gems, the game stops and displays a screen indicating that the player has won.

Welcome Screen:
The game starts with a welcome screen that provides the player with game instructions and a start
button. Once the player presses the start button, they will be taken to the game environment.

Winning and Losing Screens:
When the player collects all ten gems, the game will stop, and a screen will appear congratulating the
player for winning the game. This screen will also include a restart button. If the player loses all their
health before collecting all ten gems, the game will stop and display a screen indicating that the player
has lost. This screen will also include a restart button.
